         <h1>London with Kids</h1>
         <p>Research has shown that there are many benefits to spending time outdoors with your kids. Here are some of our top choices of interactive and fun playgrounds to visit in and around London.</p>

        <p> Surrounded by three palaces, St James Park is London's oldest Royal Park. It's an excellent green space with cycling routes to take cyclists off the busy London roads into some beautiful and attractive areas of London. The park has one play area, suitable for children 0-10 years old. Just incase you happen to be in the park without children there is also the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Walk. This is seven miles long, charted by 90 plaques set in the ground, that takes you within sight of famous buildings and locations associated with the Princess during her life. Top tip: if you go in the summer take some almonds as the parakets there love them!
