         <h1>London with Kids</h1>

        <p> The London Transport Museum is a family favourite to visit due to the fact it is set up for children. Unlike most museums whose audience is normally an older age group, the London Transport Museum is designed with young minds at heart. Within the museum there are two seperate role play areas (one even with a little bit of soft play), and then all around the museum there is several different vehicles for them to get into and try out. Including double decker buses, some of the earliest tube trains used and a traditional hackney carriage. No wonder it is known as the world's leading museum of urban transport.

        <p> What could be better than a Museum for children, about children?! The Victoria and Albert Museum of childhood is currently closed as it goes under a huge transformation to become the new and improved 'Young V&A' museum. When it reopens in Summer 2023 there will be three immersive new galleries <b> Imagine, Play and Design </b>  that will showcase around 2,000 star objects from the V&A collections and the UK's National Childhood Collection. From objects displayed at a toddlers' height, to a wardrobe of costume materials, and new spaces for hands-on making, AOC Architecture's colourful, child-centred designs will foster curiosity and a spirit of collaboration, through spaces designed for inter-generational, structured play and creative experimentation, for ages 0 – 14. We cannot wait for this to reopen in the summer!
